armstrong.core.arm_sections
===========================
Provides the basic concept of sections within an Armstrong site.

.. warning:: This is development level software.  Please do not unless you are
             familiar with what that means and are comfortable using that type
             of software.

Sections give you a way to organize your content into logical groups.  Sections
can have a parent section to allow you to create a hierarchy.  For example, the
`Texas Tribune`_ has an Immigration section which in turns has Sanctuary Cities
and Dream Act as children sections.

Of course, you can create a flat infrastructure too if you would like.  Simply
ignore the parent/child features present.  The parent/child relationship is
managed through a `django-mptt`_ using a technique called *modified preordered
tree traversal*.


Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

::

    NAME=armstrong.core.arm_sections
    pip install -e git://github.com/armstrongcms/$NAME.git#egg=$NAME

There are two settings that should be set for sections to work.  Unless you're
using a custom content model, you should be able to use these settings without
tweaking::

    ARMSTRONG_SECTION_ITEM_BACKEND="armstrong.core.arm_sections.backend.find_related_models"
    ARMSTRONG_SECTION_ITEM_MODEL="armstrong.apps.content.models.Content"

.. note:: As of version 0.1.x that shipped with Armstrong 11.06, these settings
          are required.  Future versions of armstrong.core.arm_sections will
          have these both set by default.


Usage
-----

You need to add a ``section`` field to any model that you would like to show up
in a given section.  For example::

    # your models.py
    from django.db import models
    from armstrong.core.arm_sections.models import Section


    class MyArticle(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        body = models.TextField()

        section = models.ForeignKey(Section)

You can also relate to multiple sections as well through a ``ManyToManyField``.

To display a section view, we provide the ``SimpleSectionView``. An example is
provided in the demo project which has the following in ``urls.py``::

    url(r'^section/(?P<full_slug>[-\w/]+)',
            SimpleSectionView.as_view(template_name='section.html'),
            name='section_view'),
    # renders the view identified by full_slug using section.html

A template tag to render menus is provided called ``section_menu``. It can be
customized by passing in a template, but standard usage looks like::

    {% load arm_sections %}
    {% section_menu section_view='section_view' %}

The ``section_view`` parameter tells ``section_menu`` what view to link to for
a given section. If your urls.py is configured as in the above example, the
menu will render as::

    <ul class="root">
        <li>
            <a href='/section/politics/'>Politics</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href='/section/sports/'>Sports</a>
            <ul class="children">
                <li>
                    <a href='/section/sports/football/'>Football</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href='/section/sports/basketball/'>Basketball</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href='/section/fashion/'>Fashion</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

State of Project
----------------
Armstrong is an open-source news platform that is freely available to any
organization.  It is the result of a collaboration between the `Texas Tribune`_
and `Bay Citizen`_, and a grant from the `John S. and James L. Knight
Foundation`_.  The first stable release is scheduled for September, 2011.

To follow development, be sure to join the `Google Group`_.

``armstrong.core.arm_content`` is part of the `Armstrong`_ project.  You're
probably looking for that.
